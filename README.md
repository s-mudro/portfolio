Projects I've done.


| Name | Project Tasks | Description | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Customer Churn Prediction and Offer Recommendation for a Telecommunications Operator](#) | Predicting customer churn and identifying the region with the highest profit or forecasting steel temperature during smelting. | Conducted exploratory data analysis on customer behavior for a telecommunications operator and developed a model predicting customer churn probability. This improved the recommendation system for special offers and promo codes. Utilized pandas, numpy, and sklearn. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn, exploratory data analysis, classification |
| [Comprehensive CV Project](#) | Determining a person's age using a photograph. | Created a computer vision model for a grocery chain to estimate customers' approximate age. The analysis improved the personalized promotional offer system and the oversight of cashiers' compliance during alcohol sales. Utilized pandas and keras. | Keras, Python |
| [Text Analysis Project for Online Bookshop](#) | Identifying toxic comments. | Created a model to classify comments as positive or negative for a reading service. | BERT, Pandas, Python, nltk, tf-idf |
| [Taxi Orders Forecasting](#) | Developing a system to predict order volumes. | Created an ML model to predict the number of user orders for the next hour for a ride-hailing service. | Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn, statsmodels |
| [Research on the investment fund database](#) | Analyzing a database for an investment fund. | Created complex SQL queries for databases to analyze data on funds and investments. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, SQL, SQLAlchemy, Seaborn |
| [Car Price Prediction](#) | Developing a system to recommend car prices based on their specifications. | Created a model to determine the market price of a used car for a pre-owned car sales service. Applied gradient boosting techniques. | Pandas, Python, lightgbm |
| [Protection of Insurance Company Clients' Data](#) | Developing a model to anonymize personal data. | Developed a model for anonymizing personal data. | NumPy, Python, Scikit-learn |
| [Gold Recovery ML Model](#) | Forecasting gold concentration during the purification process. | Created an ML model to predict the amount of extractable gold. Utilized data such as metal concentrations (e.g., gold, silver) at various processing stages and the concentration of chemical reagents used for extraction. The model facilitated production optimization by identifying optimal operational parameters. | Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn, exploratory data analysis |
| [Well Location Selection](#) | Choosing an oil extraction region based on geological exploration data. | Built an ML model to predict oil reserve volumes in new wells. The model accounted for characteristics such as oil quality and reserve size. It helped select the region with the highest potential profit. | Pandas, Scikit-learn, bootstrapping |
| [Bank Customer Churn Analysis](#) | Identifying customers likely to leave the bank based on data. | Created a customer behavior prediction model for a bank using sklearn. The model predicts whether a client will leave with 80% accuracy. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn |
| [Tariff Plan Recommendation Model](#) | Offering optimal tariffs to customers based on data analysis. | Created a recommendation model for mobile plans based on customer behavior data using sklearn. The model predicts a switch to a new plan with 80% accuracy. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn |
| [Game E-Commerce Analysis](#) | Determining a customer's age using a photograph. | Conducted research for an online store, which helped select the most successful product for a promotional campaign. Used pandas, seaborn, scipy, numpy. | Keras, Python |
| [Regional Revenue Analysis for a Mobile Operator](#) | Analyzing customer behavior and identifying optimal tariff plans based on data from a telecommunications company. | Conducted exploratory data analysis for a mobile operator using pandas, identified user behavior patterns across different plans. Based on the analysis, improved promotional offers. | Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Python, SciPy, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing |
| [Real Estate Listings Analysis](#) | Determining market value and typical parameters of real estate objects using data from Yandex.RealEstate. | Conducted data analysis for a real estate website using pandas and seaborn, identifying key factors determining price per square meter and calculating the average time to sell properties by region. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing |
| [Credit Reliability Analysis](#) | Studying the influence of marital status and the number of children on timely loan repayment. | Conducted exploratory data analysis for a bank using pandas, resulting in customer profiles with varying creditworthiness. | Pandas, Python, data preprocessing |
| [Music Preferences in Moscow and St. Petersburg](#) | Validating data and comparing user behavior and preferences in Moscow and St. Petersburg using Yandex.Music data. | Compared music preferences across cities for a streaming service using pandas. Analyzed hypotheses, leading to improvements in recommendation algorithms. | Pandas, Python |
