Projects I've done.

| Name | Description | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Telecom Churn & Promo Recommendation](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/16_telecom_churn_prediction) | Conducted exploratory data analysis on customer behavior for a telecommunications operator and developed a model predicting customer churn probability. This improved the recommendation system for special offers and promo codes. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn, exploratory data analysis, classification |
| [Customer Age Estimation for Retail](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/15_customers_age_estimation_cv) | Created a computer vision model for a grocery chain to estimate customers' approximate age. The analysis improved the personalized promotional offer system and the oversight of cashiers' compliance during alcohol sales. | Keras, Pandas |
| [Text Analysis for Online Bookshop](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/14_text_analysis_online_bookshop) | Created a model to classify comments as positive or negative for a reading service. | BERT, Pandas, nltk, tf-idf |
| [Taxi Orders Prediction](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/13_taxi_orders_predictions) | Created an ML model to predict the number of user orders for the next hour for a ride-hailing service. | Pandas, Scikit-learn, statsmodels |
| [Investment Fund Database Research](#) | Created complex SQL queries for databases to analyze data on funds and investments. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, SQL, SQLAlchemy, Seaborn |
| [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/11_car_price_prediction) | Created a model to determine the market price of a used car for a pre-owned car sales service. Applied gradient boosting techniques. | Pandas, LightGBM |
| [Clients Data Protection](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/10_clients_data_protection) | Developed a model for anonymizing personal data. | NumPy, Scikit-learn |
| [Gold Recovery Optimization](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/09_gold_recovery) | Created an ML model to predict the amount of extractable gold. Utilized data such as metal concentrations (e.g., gold, silver) at various processing stages and the concentration of chemical reagents used for extraction. The model facilitated production optimization by identifying optimal operational parameters. | Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn, exploratory data analysis |
| [Well Location Selection](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/08_well_location_selection) | Built an ML model to predict oil reserve volumes in new wells. The model accounted for characteristics such as oil quality and reserve size. It helped select the region with the highest potential profit. | Pandas, Scikit-learn, bootstrapping |
| [Bank Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/07_customer_churn_research) | Created a customer behavior prediction model for a bank using sklearn. The model predicts whether a client will leave with 80% accuracy. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn |
| [Tariff Plan Recommendation Model](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/06_tariff_recommendation) | Created a recommendation model for mobile plans based on customer behavior data using sklearn. The model predicts a switch to a new plan with 80% accuracy. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn |
| [Game E-Commerce Analysis](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/05_ecommerce_research) | Conducted research for an online store, which helped select the most successful product for a promotional campaign. Used pandas, seaborn, scipy, numpy. | Keras, Pandas |
| [Mobile Operator Plan Optimization](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/04_telecom_tariff_revenue_comparison) | Conducted exploratory data analysis for a mobile operator using pandas, identified user behavior patterns across different plans. Based on the analysis, improved promotional offers. | Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing |
| [Real Estate Listings Analysis](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/03_real_estate_sales_spb) | Conducted data analysis for a real estate website using pandas and seaborn, identifying key factors determining price per square meter and calculating the average time to sell properties by region. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing |
| [Credit Reliability Analysis](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/02_research_of_borrowers_reliability) | Conducted exploratory data analysis for a bank using pandas, resulting in customer profiles with varying creditworthiness. | Pandas, data preprocessing |
| [Music Preferences in Moscow and St. Petersburg](https://github.com/s-mudro/portfolio/tree/main/01_musical_preferences_of_msk_spb) | Compared music preferences across cities for a streaming service using pandas. Analyzed hypotheses, leading to improvements in recommendation algorithms. | Pandas, data preprocessing |
